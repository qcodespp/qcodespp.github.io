Reminder to myself on how to update the docs if the API is changed.

In the /docs/source/conf file, uncomment the autoapi-related pieces.

In anaconda prompt:
activate qcodespp-docs
cd C:/git/qcodespp.github.io/docs
sphinx-build -M html source build

Comment out again all the autoapi-related lines in the conf file.

Commit and push.

Everything except the commit and push is now done automatically by running automake.bat
